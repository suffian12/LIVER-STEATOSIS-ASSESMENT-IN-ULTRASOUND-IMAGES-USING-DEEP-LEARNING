# LIVER-STEATOSIS-ASSESMENT-IN-ULTRASOUND-IMAGES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
This project is based on detection of liver disease whcih we check based on ultrasound images and clinical data which we did with combinations of two models.

1.An EfficientNet-based image classifier for ultrasound images.

2.An AdaBoost classifier for clinical data analysis.

# Features.
- assessment of liver steatosin based on ultrasound images.
- detection of liver disease based on clinical data.

  # setup
  1. you need to import all the libraries which is I added in my repository withe name of efficient aug.py.
  2. You need to upload the data sets also first.
  3. Then you need to run this file code for model testing and save it.
  4. In the end you also open a file of gui in which you can load both model and testing it.
